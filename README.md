# CodeSnippets
A selection of files I've written.


As I have the opportunity to do more projects, I will add add them to this folder. 
As of now (15SEP2020) I am only putting the files I was responsible for from my Bruinopoly class project. 
Out of these files, I was particularly pleased with the chancecard class and the way cards are "added to the chance card deck" in the board.cpp file. 

These files out of context are a bit confusing so the full project is also available for context in the corresponding repository.
