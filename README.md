# CodeSnippets
A selection of files I've written.


As I have the opportunity to do more projects, I will add add them to this folder. 
As of now (15SEP2020) I am only putting the files I was responsible for from my Bruinopoly class project. 
Out of these files, I was particularly pleased with the chancecard class and the way cards are "added to the chance card deck" in the board.cpp file. 
Some of the functions may be unclear since this is not all the project files.  The full project is available on this github as well.
